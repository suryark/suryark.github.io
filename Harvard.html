											<h3>A Course at Harvard</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Over the course of January 2016, I visited Harvard University to do a non-credit course on The Economics of Financial Markets. The course was offered as part of the winter session at Harvard. My classes were scheduled to be held at the historic and famous Harvard Yard, just a five minute walk from my place of residence. They were held at Emerson Hall, which is the main building of Psychology at Harvard.</p>
										<p>The first week, we covered the concept of money, the exogenous and endogenous supply of money, money multipliers, and the supply and demand for money in the market. These concepts were new to me at the time, and since the course was squeezed into three weeks, required my consistent concentration, and although they are macro economic in nature, require a basic understanding of micro economics as well.</p>
										<p>The second week the course work went through Bond Markets and Interest Rates, Factors affecting Short Term and Long Term Interest and exchange rates, and foreign exchange intervention. These subjects are highly macro economic in nature. Though the course work itself was manageable, it required spending time in the local Cambridge Library and sometimes the Harvard library, to ensure full understanding, and also to complete assignments and study for midterms. The mid term examination was held during the second week. I found out later, that my examination was not graded, since I was doing the course non-credit. This also meant that I would not be able to take the final examination, since doing non-credit would allow me the chance to come back and do the course with academic credit.</p>
                                        <p>The final week was spent studying how stocks are priced, the efficiency of the stock market, hedging and speculating, and financial swap contracts. The final examination was also held during the final week, and even though I was not allowed to take it I spent my time studying the concepts and finishing up the assignments as was required. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        The course by itself was an intense learning experience. It was some of the most cerebral work that I have done, requiring a lot of attention and effort. However it was a great experience which has given me the motivation to go back to Harvard to do a Masters in either Public Policy or Business.
