											<h3>An Internship at Apple</h3>
										</header>
										<p>In the summer of 2014, I was employed as an intern at Apple Inc. in Singapore. My job title was World Wide Test Engineering Intern, and I worked in the Operations Engineering department. My job was to automate the process of Gage Reproducibility and Repeatability or GRR calculation.</p>
										<p>My first task was to learn what GRR was and where is was applied. Thanks to all reading materials provided by my supervisor, Mr. Raymond Samalo, I was able to teach myself the basic principles within a week. My knowledge was and is not in depth, just a surface understanding that enabled me to complete this project. GRR is a statistical tool used to assess measuring equipment. It uses the principles of analysis of variance (ANOVA) to accomplish this. In simple terms, GRR needs to be done on any measuring equipment in factories (from simple voltmeters, to complex machinery which measure a number of things at once), to ensure that these pieces of equipment are taking accurate measurements. In the world of consumer goods, accuracy is necessary and ANOVA GRR helps achieve a high level of that. Another amazing feature of the ANOVA method for GRR calculation is that it takes into account human error. </p>
										<p>Now that I knew what I would be applying, the next task was to figure out how to do so. Firstly, the current situation had to be examined. The preliminary, measuring process needs to be done by various people (on the same tool) to complete the test. This will be time consuming, but it has to be done for the test, hence cannot be changed. Once the tests have been done, the various files are stored in a repository. The traditional method of calculation involves a technician downloading all the relevant files, going through the files one by one, inputing the values into an excel sheet, and running the calculation. By my own experimentation, I found that this takes about 4-5 minutes per file. If we consider a reasonable number of files per day per machine station ~ 50, this means the technician spends about 3-4 hours a day just running these calculations. If we take into consideration 200 machine stations in a factory, almost 700 man hours are spent calculating the GRR result per day!</p>
                                        <p>So the primary goal of my project was to automate this calculation process. The files were of the .csv (Comma separated values) file type with about 90 values per file and many parameters.
                                        So my very first task was to order this data. I did so using Python, pushing all the values into matrices (lists) and making them ready for the ANOVA calculation. Within a short amount of time, I succeeded in doing this for one file and running the ANOVA GRR calculation. I used this to create a Terminal tool which could be executed when given the file location. Since I was given
                                        access to a few files, my program was very obviously tailored to the formatting (Header line) of these files.</p>
                                        <p>Once the tool was ready, I sent it out for user testing to get feedback. What I heard back was incredibly disheartening. My tool did not work for most files that the testers used. For the ones that it did work for, the output format was not to their liking. My supervisor was very helpful in this period as I tried to figure out how to tackle the problem of multiple formats.</p>
                                        <p>After a few sessions of brainstorming together, we figured out that the best way would be to hand some responsibility to the user. We came up with the idea of making a template creator. The user would be able to make a template file based on the formatting of the files the user was about to process. The main components of the template were the header line, the data start line, and a bunch of other parameters. Once these parameters were explicitly stated, the tool could function without a hitch. To make this tool more user friendly, my supervisor asked me to design an application, which he would then help me code. I designed the application on paper. Due to the limiting time constraint (this was already in Week 8 of my 12 Week internship), he helped me with most of the coding for the user interface. The application would still use my program behind the scenes to run the calculation and generate output files.</p>
                                        <p>The first of the major modifications I made at this point were to enable batch processing. Since the user created a template for one file, he would be able to process multiple files in one go. Instead of selecting one file at a time, the user could place all similar format files in the same folder and select the entire folder in the application. The application would then process each file in the folder individually. Another modification, was to add an excel output. Not only did this generated excel file have all the relevant info for error assessment, it also had graphs and charts pinpointing the source of the error. The final user tests came back with positive results, with praise for the Interface and Output.</p>
                                        <p>This project taught me a lot of things. On the technical side, it opened the doors to <strong>Process Management and Quality Control</strong>, enabled me to learn a lot more about coding in <strong>Python and Unix (bash)</strong>, and allowed me to dip my feet into <strong>User Interface Design</strong>. On the side of soft skills and character development, it gave me a huge challenge. The results of the first user tests were terrible. I had a shortening time line, and needed to make vast changes to my project. But with a lot of hard work and perseverance, and not to mention constant and unwavering support of my Supervisor, the task was completed. My final presentation in Week 11 of my project went very well, thanks to hours spent preparing and practicing for it, and dry runs with my Supervisor and random people from the office.</p>
